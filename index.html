    <h1>The History of AMD Ryzen Processors</h1>
    <p>The AMD Ryzen line was announced on December 13, 2016. On March 2, the following year, the first Ryzen series of processors was launched. This was AMD's return to the high-end CPU market since 2006. Before their return, Intel had largely held the market share of high-end CPUs</p>

    <h2>The Ryzen 1000 Series</h2>
    <p>With the launch of the Ryzen 1000 series, it featured new specifications such as 8 cores and 16 threads. It also allowed for support of DDR4 memory modules. The 1000 series was designed for AM4 motherboard sockets. The price of the chips varied, starting from 109USD to 499USD.</p>

    <h2>The Ryzen 2000 Series</h2>
    <p>The following year, AMD released the Ryzen 2000 series which was based on teh Zen+ architecture. In their marketing for the 2000 series processors, they have stated that with the Ryzen 2950x there is an up to 131% increase in price-perfomance under heavy workloads as compared to intel's most powerful chip at the time, the Intel i9-7900x. The 2000 series started at 99USD to 329USD.</p>
    <h2>Ryzen 3000 Series</h2>
    <p>In 2019, AMD launched its third generation of Ryzen Processors. The chipset used AMD's Zen 2 architecture. What makes the 3000 series unique is that it was AMD's first release that allowed for a consumer-grade chip to have 16 cores and 32 threads. This performance came at a heavy price, as the price of the processors started at 99USD and reaching up to 749USD.</p>
    <h2>The Ryzen 7000 Series</h2>
    <p>Skipping foward a few years, on August 29, 2022, AMD annonuced the 7000 series of Ryzen Processors. The seventh generation of Ryzen processors allowed for up to 16 cores and 32 threads. On February 28, 2023, AMD released the 7950X3D. The 7000 series is special because it was the first generation to allow for socket AM5.</p>
    <h2>The Threadripper Line</h2>
    <p>The Threadripper line of AMD CPUs is different in the way that it is not intended for consumer-grade computers. It was intended for high-end computers as it contains 64 cores and 128 threads. It shines in video editing as it can process up to 4K resolution. The Threadripper line varies in price, starting at 139USD up to 5,599USD.</p>
